## Course Learning Outcomes

After taking this course, I hope: 

- Theoretically, (1) I will introduce the data (especially spatial data) visualization method and (2) demonstrate the power of visual analytics in data (especially spatial data) analysis. After taking this course, you will be able to (3)  assess visual representations according to design and perceptual principles and (4) select appropriate visualization methods for a given combination of data type and intended analysis task.

- Practically, we will learn how to (1) use visualization toolkits (e.g., Tableau, Python) as well as (2) design and implement static and interactive visualizations.
